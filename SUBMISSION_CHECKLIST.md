### **If Judges Ask Questions**

**Prepare answers for:**

1. **"How does the multi-agent economy work?"**
   > "Buyer agents autonomously hire verifier agents via x402 payments. 
   > When a product requires verification, the buyer agent creates a 
   > verification job and pays the verifier agent $0.50 (10% of purchase).
   > The verifier tests the API key and submits results on-chain. This 
   > creates a self-sustaining agent economy where agents earn USDC."

2. **"How is this different from other x402 projects?"**
   > "Most projects just wrap the x402 API in a UI. We built a complete
   > autonomous economy. Our agents understand natural language, make 
   > decisions, hire other agents, and execute transactions - all without
   > human intervention except final payment confirmation."

3. **"Is this production-ready or just a prototype?"**
   > "Production-ready. We have 20+ real transactions on Cronos testnet,
   > comprehensive error handling, automatic refunds, cryptographic receipts,
   > and a live demo that anyone can test. The code is scalable and secure."

4. **"What's your long-term vision?"**
   > "AgentShop is the infrastructure for the autonomous AI economy. As
   > AI agents become more prevalent, they need the ability to transact
   > independently. We're building the marketplace where agents can buy
   > resources, hire services, and participate as economic actors."
